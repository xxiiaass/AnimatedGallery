## How to Update Photos

### Local Photo Updates

1. **Add Your Photos**
   - Place your photos in the `photos` directory at the project root
   - Images will be automatically compressed during build
   - Original folder structure will be maintained

2. **Preview and Build**
   - For local preview: `npm run dev`
   - Check the layout and loading effects
   - To build for production: `npm run build`
   - Compressed photos will be in `public/photos`

### Update Hosted Photos

1. **Build the Project**
   - Run `npm run build` in the root directory
   - This will generate optimized photos in the `dist` directory

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   - Option 1: Deploy to username.github.io
     ```sh
     cd dist
     git init
     git add -A
     git commit -m "deploy gallery"
     git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[username].github.io.git
     git push -f origin main
     ```
     - Visit `username.github.io` to view your gallery

   - Option 2: Deploy as a subdirectory
     - If your username.github.io is occupied, create a new repo (e.g., `gallery`)
     - Deploy to this repo and it will be available at `username.github.io/gallery`
     - Update your CDN configuration in `package.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "config": {
         "cdn": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/[username]/gallery/photos/"
       }
     }
     ```
